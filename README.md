This repository contains all of my homework and labs that I completed for this course. 

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: The reason for this repository being published is so that it may serve as a) personal reference, and b) proof that I understand the concepts taught in the course. <u>As such, I do not condone plagarism or academic misconduct in any way</u>. Do not clone, reproduce, or steal the code in this repository, as that is plagarism.

> Per the University of Connecticut's [academic integrity policy](https://community.uconn.edu/the-student-code/the-student-code-appendix-a/), "Academic misconduct is dishonest or unethical academic behavior that includes, but is not limited to, misrepresenting mastery in an academic area (e.g., cheating), failing to properly credit information, research, or ideas to their rightful originators or representing such information, research, or ideas as your own (e.g., plagiarism)."

COURSE DESCRIPTION: CSE2050 "Data Structures and Object-Oriented Design" - Introduction to fundamental data structures and algorithms. The emphasis is on understanding how to efficiently implement different data structures, communicate clearly about design decisions, and understand the relationships among implementations, design decisions, and the four pillars of object-oriented programming: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
